The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc-
tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi-
ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol-
ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine
learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam-
ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes
in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of
pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among
various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and
map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo-
rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities
around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex-
traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us-
ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti-
cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be
mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as
defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in-
clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and
will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova-
tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol-
umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be
supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo-
rithms will segment the images at multiple scales. The third area of innovation will focus on efficient multi-
channel analysis. The proposed project will include creation of an easy-to-use software tool for assembling and
visualizing multiscale tissue data called Tissue Atlas Navigation Graphical Overview (TANGO).",587413

Spatially resolved molecular maps of mammalian organs hold significant promise in providing a deeper
understanding of human organ functioning in health and disease states. Fundamental to this is an
understanding how tissue organization impacts on the state of a cell and performance of its function.
The overarching goal of the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) and specifically of Tissue
Mapping Centers within the HuBMAP framework is to generate high-resolution three dimensional (3D)
human tissue maps. Present state-of-the-art spatially-resolved tissue analysis assays (e.g. MERFISH, seq-
FISH, imaging mass cytometry) utilize antibody-based or oligo probe-based approaches that require prior
knowledge of the biomolecular targets to map, challenging the ability to characterize the terra incognita (i.e.
the unknown) in a tissue mapping effort. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based omic mapping technologies enable
unbiased detection and mapping of metabolites, lipids, and proteins (including post-translational
modifications - PTMs) in situ in tissue samples with high-resolution and represents an excellent complement
to highly multiplexed targeted approaches for spatially resolved tissue analysis.
The overall objective of this application is to generate high-resolution, multi-omic, 3D biomolecular maps of
non-diseased human organs. We will take a Google Maps-type approach with our mapping effort progressing
in phases to generate reference maps at increasing resolution. First, single-cell or near-single-cell resolution
MS-based mapping technologies will be used to provide an unbiased view of tissue molecular spatial
architecture. Second, biomolecules of interest will be subsequently interrogated with highly multiplexed sub-
cellular resolution spatial omics assays in a targeted fashion. Our focus will be on the pancreas, an essential
organ important for several metabolic functions. Notably, the pancreas, despite its importance, is not one of
the listed key tissues and organs currently being analyzed by the HuBMAP consortium further supporting the
need to focus on this critical organ. We will employ high resolving power and high-resolution mass
spectrometry-based molecular mapping platforms (LMD-nanoPOT-MS, MALDI-FTMS, nanoDESI-MS) for
unbiased mapping of metabolites, lipids, and proteins (including PTMs such as phosphorylation). These MS
assays will be complemented with powerful highly multiplexed targeted spatial omics assays (CODEX and
NanoString GeoMx for protein and RNA respectively) and light sheet microscopy to generate high-resolution,
multi-omics human tissue maps. The innovative spatially resolved multi-omic tissue maps generated will be
unprecedented and the unique multi-omic datasets will provide many novel insights. The tissue mapping
efforts will be supported by commercially available and open-source state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction
software to create browsable 3D RNA/protein/PTM/lipid/metabolite maps of the pancreas. Undergirding the
tissue characterization and 3D organ map reconstructions efforts will be a robust organ procurement,
processing and distribution network.
Specifically, we will: (1) Procure, process and distribute samples of normal pancreas from non-diseased
donors through a robust procurement, processing, and distribution network. (2) Perform comprehensive
high-resolution multi-omics tissue mapping through innovative and complementary platforms for unbiased
and targeted analyses (that includes gene and protein expression, and PTM, metabolite and lipid abundances).
(3) Establish browsable 3D multi-omics (RNA / protein / PTM / lipid / metabolite)-based maps of normal
non-diseased pancreas; and to disseminate methods and tools to the HIVE and other TMCs.",750693

we have well-established relationships with the U.S. Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO), having referrals
from 56/58 over the last decade. Our standard operating procedures (SOPs), both published and web-based,
include assessment of normality, quality control assays, and systematic anatomical dissection/storage. We
also participate in National QA/QC programs to evaluate tissue processing/banking procedures. Our approach
to developing assay pipelines towards the common goal of a 3D tissue map will initially involve acquiring a
macro image of the intact tissue and addressing tissue morphology, using our strengths in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). The proposed optical microscopy pipeline will address microanatomical features using formalin
fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) and optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound embedded sections as well
as tissue optical clearing and expansion. These specimens will be studied from nm to mm resolution using
stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), confocal, multiphoton and light sheet fluorescence
microscopies (LSFM), with all pipelines sharing a common file format for simplified 3D reconstruction. Based
on the unique role for lymphatic organs in production and trafficking of immune cells, fluorescence activated
cell sorting (FACS) of cells from blood and each lymphatic organ will provide a comparison of the patient-
specific immune cell repertoire and serve in subsequent single cell RNA-seq analyses. To co-register
biomolecules to their cognate cells, we will employ imaging mass cytometry (IMC), multiplex single molecule
fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) and multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH) to map cellular
protein and mRNA expression, ultimately on each 3D tissue atlas. Our experience in organ procurement, the

specific immune cell repertoire and serve in subsequent single cell RNA-seq analyses. To co-register
biomolecules to their cognate cells, we will employ imaging mass cytometry (IMC), multiplex single molecule
fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) and multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH) to map cellular

The ultimate goal of the HIVE Mapping effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the
healthy human body that supports the cataloguing of different types of individual cells, understanding the func-
tion and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. In order
to exploit human and machine intelligence, different visual interfaces will be implemented that use the CCF in
support of data exploration and communication.
The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization,
mathematical biology, and biomedical data standards to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimen-
sional spatial basemap of the human body and associated data overlays that can be interactively explored
online as an atlas of tissue maps. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect

The ultimate goal of the HIVE Mapping effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the
healthy human body that supports the cataloguing of different types of individual cells, understanding the func-
tion and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. In order
to exploit human and machine intelligence, different visual interfaces will be implemented that use the CCF in
support of data exploration and communication.
The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization,
mathematical biology, and biomedical data standards to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimen-
sional spatial basemap of the human body and associated data overlays that can be interactively explored
online as an atlas of tissue maps. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect
metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across the human body
along multiple functional contexts (e.g., systems physiology, vascular, or endocrine systems), and connect and
integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources as driven by the context or
“position” on the map. The CCF and the interactive data visualizations will be multi-level and multi-scale sup-
porting the exploration and communication of tissue and publication data--from single cell to whole body.

We propose to establish the Caltech-UW Tissue Mapping Center (TMC), which will serve as one of the T​MCs
of the NIH’s Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP). The overarching goal of the TMCs is to generate
high-resolution, high-content multiscale maps of non-diseased human organs and systems. To this end, we
propose a TMC that brings together the developers of leading technologies for multiplex spatial transcriptomics
(Long Cai, seqFISH) and ultra-scalable methods for single cell profiling of chromatin accessibility and
transcriptomes (Shendure & Trapnell, sci-ATAC-seq and sci-RNA-seq). Through an organ specific project
(OSP), we describe a pipeline to collect high quality, normal human samples with explicit consent for open
access genome data sharing (GDS) and distribution to consortium members. We will characterize and quantify
the molecular heterogeneity of the human circulatory system in relation to multiple facets of its anatomical
distribution, including organ-specific heterogeneity, intra-organ zonality, down to cell-to-cell heterogeneity.
Through an iterative approach involving profiling of spatially intact tissues by seqFISH and disaggregated cells
by sci-ATAC-seq and sci-RNA-seq, we will obtain a spatially resolved, comprehensive molecular portrait of
both chromatin accessibility and gene expression across the human circulatory system. Through incidental
collection, we anticipate generating expression and chromatin accessibility data for diverse cell types in all
organs that we survey, which will critically inform and increase the value of the datasets collected by other
TMCs and OSPs. We will work closely and openly with the other TMCs and the broader HuBMAP program to
share and integrate data as well as methods and ultimately build a broadly useful platform for exploring and
understanding human organs and systems at high molecular and anatomical resolution.",566374

This project focuses on the accelerated development of a high-spatial-resolution sequencing technology for the
co-mapping of transcriptomes and proteomes (hsrTP-seq) via deterministic barcoding in tissue, which will be
validated with paraformaldehyde(PFA)-fixed and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human tissue
specimens. This is a fundamentally new approach as compared to any existing spatial omics technologies. The
core idea is to molecularly barcode RNAs, proteins, or other biomolecular information in tissues using a novel
microfluidic in situ barcoding method. The tissue slide after barcoding remains morphologically intact but
consists of a mosaic of tissue pixels, each of which has a distinct DNA barcode. The size of the pixels is as
small as ~5-10μm, which is close to the size of individual cells. It is built upon the power of Illumina’s Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS) systems to achieve significantly higher sample high-throughput, lower cost, and
the elimination of laborious procedures for repeated single-molecule imaging as in seqFISH. It will demonstrate
high-spatial-resolution (~5-10μm pixel size), high-throughput (up to 100 tissue samples flow barcoded per day
per operator), and high-content (genome-wide mRNAs, proteins, and non-cellular environment). Using a panel
of DNA-tagged antibodies against extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, this approach further allows for spatial
omics sequencing to include the mapping of non-cellular components, which are completely missing in scRNA-
seq or current spatial transcriptomics technologies. It is uniquely suited for mapping human collagenous
tissues including heart, aorta, skin, and kidney to improve our understanding of the role of ECM in normal
physiology, disease and aging. We will pursue the following specific aims. In the UG3 phase, we will develop a
set of new devices to significantly increase the tissue mapping area (4mmx4mm), develop a proteome-scale
(~500 proteins co-analyzed) and ECM-inclusive spatial sequencing, and develop a novel tissue optimization
protocol performed on the same tissue slide for hsrTP-seq, and generate a set of 3D spatial transcriptome-
proteome atlas data from human heart or aorta. In the UH3 phase, we will further develop a multi-pin injection
head to increase sample throughput (up to 100 samples per day) and the mapping area (1.2cmx1.2cm) for
further scale up and automation, develop a new in-tissue template switching method to retain intact tissue
section after hsrTP-seq for conducting other measurements on the same tissue slide and constructing 3D
tissue atlas, and finally develop an optimized PFA and FFPE tissue protocol to generate the 3D multi-omics
tissue atlas data (>20 tissue sections per sample) from the human heart, aorta, skin, and kidney.",400000

The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc-
tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi-
ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol-
ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine
learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam-
ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes
in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of
pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among
various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and
map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo-
rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities
around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex-
traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us-
ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti-
cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be
mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as
defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in-
clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and
will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova-
tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol-
umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be
supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo-
rithms will segment the images at multiple scales. The third area of innovation will focus on efficient multi-
channel analysis. The proposed project will include creation of an easy-to-use software tool for assembling and
visualizing multiscale tissue data called Tissue Atlas Navigation Graphical Overview (TANGO).",750000

The mapping of healthy human tissue is an ongoing challenge, critical to which is understanding the cellular
distribution and composition of biomolecules. Among these biomolecules, proteins are perhaps the least
regularized and deeply understood, with their myriad proteoforms created within cells of distinct types. Here, we
outline a new measurement framework poised to better illuminate the underlying cell types and structure defining
solid tissues types in human health and wellness. We propose a two-step process that identifies and
characterizes selected proteins within cells of human tissue and offers the HuBMAP Consortium highly validated
and renewable affinity reagents in the process. Step 1 involves the rapid deployment of previously developed,
recombinant affinity reagents (rABs) and the precise characterization of whole proteoforms in human colon tissue
recognized by them. Step 2 involves the creation of “smart” probes that work on specific post-translational
modifications (PTMs) in a ‘proteoform-aware’ fashion. The result will be specific, renewable and extremely
validated affinity probes that are readily disseminated for use by HuBMAP Tissue Mapping Centers (TMCs).
Importantly, these recombinant antibodies (rABs) will be among the most characterized of any in terms of their
molecular recognition by the end of the three year granting period. This is because of the kind of low-bias readout
that employs “top-down” mass spectrometry (TDMS) to interrogate whole proteoforms and their PTMs directly
(no proteolysis prior to mass spectrometry).
The direct deliverable of this activity will be 30 affinity reagents (20 simple and 10 smart rABs that recognize
PTMs) and hundreds of characterized proteoforms to key targets of high interest to HuBMAP. The affinity
reagents that emerge will be in a recombinant and renewable form (i.e., proven to express in E. coli) that are
ready for use in a variety of imaging modalities through conjugation to fluorescent probes. These will be
applicable to immunofluorescence by confocal microscopy, imaging CyTOF (MIBI), and DNA-barcoded
antibodies to name a few. The stringent process of development and validation represents a general approach
to better map both the chemical space of proteins and their spatial distribution in tissue at cellular and sub-
cellular resolution. Our combined platform focuses on the biologically active forms of proteins (proteoforms) and
the PTMs decorating them that maintain health and wellness in the human body. PTM maps enabled by smart
and renewable reagents represent a high value outcome, templated here through this collaborative effort

HuBMAP, to define a molecular map of the entire system, integrating multi-modal assays, spatial
diversity, and individual variations has not been established. The Penn Department of Obstetrics and

female reproductive system using six different molecular assays for at least ~700 tissue samples in
anatomically indexed samples, creating a key resource for both basic science and women’s health. The
molecular assays include single cell RNAseq, clampFISH spatial transcriptomics, simultaneous single
cell open chromatin and RNA assays, and spatial open chromatin assay, among others. We will also
generate a 3D anatomical model to provide spatial coordinate for our molecular characterization. All
assay data will be registered to our 3D anatomical map that will be integrated with the HIVE Common

Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial
mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require
any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput
automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited
by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic
shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly
innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high-
resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray
ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle
localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined
between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass
spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables
detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity,
high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly
quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments
is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration.
This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput
imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved
using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for
robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning
and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to
different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple

Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial
mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require
any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput
automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited
by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic
shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly
innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high-
resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray
ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle
localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined
between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass
spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables
detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity,
high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly
quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments
is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration.
This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput
imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved
using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for
robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning
and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to
different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple
classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform
will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable
to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease",630000

The primary goal of this Female Reproductive Tissue Mapping Center is to develop three-dimensional
multiscale maps of the placenta, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes spanning multiple physiological states
across the reproductive lifespan, including pregnancy, the proliferative/follicular and secretory/luteal phases of
the menstrual period, and the postmenopausal period. To do this, we will apply a range of imaging and
molecular profiling modalities, including in vivo MRI and ultrasound imaging, and ex vivo extracellular matrix
proteomics, formal histopathologic evaluation, biomechanical testing, imaging mass cytometry, and spatial
transcriptomics, with the resulting data being analyzed and distributed to the broader research community in
collaboration with the HuBMAP Integration, Visualization, and Engagement (HIVE) Collaboratory. This project
is relevant to public health because the resulting 3D multiscale maps of normal female reproductive tissues will
serve as key frames of reference for future studies aiming to discover how perturbation of tissue structure
and/or function leads to organ dysfunction in common, yet poorly understood, conditions such as
preeclampsia, endometriosis, female infertility, and gynecologic cancers.",NICHD,10119154,9/22/2020,RFA-RM20-002,1U54HD104393-01,1,U54,HD,104393,01,,"HALVORSON, LISA M",9/25/2020,8/31/2022,Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BST-U(50)R],,9491679,"LAURENT, LOUISE CHANG",Not Applicable,52,OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY,804355790,US,32.881785,-117.236973,577507,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,920930934,UNITED STATES,N,9/25/2020,8/31/2021,865,Research Centers,2020,600000,,OD,405652,194348,,"SUMMARY
The placenta, uterus, ovary, and fallopian tube act in concert to achieve successful pregnancy outcomes.
These organs undergo marked changes in structure and function throughout the lifespan, coordinating with
one another via direct and distant cell-cell interactions. Here, we propose to generate and integrate data from
in vivo imaging and ex vivo histopathologic, biomechanical, and multi-omic spatial profiling data, in order to
generate reference multiscale 3D maps of healthy human female reproductive organs representing a range of
normal physiologic states that exist at different points in a woman’s life. These will serve as key frames of
reference for future studies aiming to discover how perturbation of tissue structure and function leads to organ
dysfunction and disease. Our team is well-equipped to achieve this goal, with expertise in clinical Obstetrics &
Gynecology and Placental/Perinatal and Gynecologic Pathology, imaging, spatial molecular profiling, single-
cell omics, extracellular matrix (ECM) biology, biomechanical testing, data management, and computational
biology. We will leverage our well-established translational research infrastructure to recruit diverse cohorts of
healthy pregnant women and non-pregnant premenopausal and postmenopausal women undergoing
gynecologic surgery for benign indications. We will then perform in vivo imaging using MRI and ultrasound to
delineate tissue structure, perfusion, inflammation, calcifications, and other features. After delivery/surgery,
tissues will be rapidly sampled, processed, and stored in multiple ways (fresh, flash frozen, preserved in
solutions for optimal nucleic acid analysis, and FFPE) to enable generation of high-quality data using a variety
of molecular approaches, with extra samples retained for future studies. Detailed review of clinical data and
formal histopathologic evaluation of adjacent tissue sections will be performed to confirm that normal tissue
has been obtained from subjects with normal outcomes. Initial ex vivo analysis will include biomechanical
testing, extracellular matrix proteomics, and bulk and single-cell RNAseq and ATACseq. The results of these
studies will be analyzed to identify targets for the subsequent imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and spatial
transcriptomic studies. These data types will be integrated to enable mapping of the relationships among
different cell types and between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix on the microscopic level, and
between tissue architecture and the biomechanical properties and imaging features on a macroscopic level.
The unique populations of endothelial cells in the placenta and the endothelial mimicry of the extravillous
trophoblast will provide unique opportunities to integrate with other endothelial-centric HuBMAP projects (e.g.
lymphatic system, endothelial atlas, and kidney atlas). Close interactions with other HuBMAP Centers will be
established to enable harmonization of data and metadata standards, sharing of resources (e.g. antibodies
with HuBMAP Centers that are developing/using CODEX and MIBI-TOF), rapid adoption of new technologies,
collaborative data analysis, and rapid sharing of data with the HIVE and the broader scientific community.",600000

Differentiated cells have distinctive patterns of epigenetic marks including various post-translational
modifications (PTMs) on histones that may work in concert to control transcriptional programs. Since epigenetic
marks are often altered following exposure to environmental toxins and play multiple roles in disease
pathogenesis, the ability to measure histones in a tissue and cell context is a major analytical objective and
challenge. Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics is a powerful tool for characterizing histone alterations in
multiplexed and non-targeted fashion. However, conventional bottom-up (i.e. peptide-level) MS cannot provide
complete characterization of the stoichiometry and combinations of multiple PTMs, and other combinatorial
sources of variation, that collectively make up any single gene's set of proteoforms (i.e. functional units of a
proteome). Top-down (i.e. proteoform-level) MS addresses this challenge by omitting the proteolysis and thus
allowing access to the functional proteoforms. However, top-down MS suffers from low sensitivity and dynamic
range due to challenges in separation and detection of large and low-abundance proteins and laborious
purification steps required to achive high proteome coverage. This severely limits our ability to analyze small
samples and employ top-down MS to generate proteoform-aware images of tissues required for a deeper
understanding of human organ functioning in health and disease. We have recently developed nanodroplet
sample preparation (nanoPOTS) for highly sensitive bottom-up proteomics and extended this approach to tissue
imaging with 100 µm spatial resolution. Herein, we propose to develop and deploy nanoPOTS-based top-down
MS to enable characterization of proteoforms in tissue sections with near single cell resolution. To increase the
resolution from thousands of cells to near single cell, we will employ advanced MS imaging (MSI) approaches.
MSI data will be cross-referenced with global proteomics data obtained via microscale top-down MS of
microdissected tissue regions. The UG3 phase efforts will be focused on histones and kidney as a development
platform and leverage a unique combination of microscale top-down LCMS, MSI and novel image processing
and visualization tools. In the UH3 phase, we will construct comprehensive proteoform-specific maps of multiple
tissue types and facilitate multimodal molecular mapping of specific functional units of the kidney by leveraging
the HubMAP Consortium ongoing efforts. Successful completion of this research will allow for comprehensive
characterization of the full spectrum of proteoforms in tissues and cells thus addressing an important and under-
studied area of biology and critical gap in HuBMAP efforts.",300000

The goal of the HuBMAP program is to appreciate the unique contextual role of individual cells within the 3D
structure of a tissue at its most basic level of transcriptional activity, cellular signaling and cellular response.
To date the subject tissues have not included the mineralized skeletal system due to technical issues that
preclude the requirements of the HuBMAP program. We have solved those issues with a protocol that is
capable of performing multimodal histology that include methods for advanced and repetitive in situ
hybridization. We will develop this technology for three very different mineralized skeletal tissues: tooth,
trabecular bone and cartilage structures of the knee. The Coordination Core will acquire the three tissue types
from de-identified human sources. Each sample will be oriented to its source tissue, imaged by µCT to capture
its mineral structure and processed into a histological stack to create a 3D representation of the tissue. Using
the histological stack, the Mineralized Tissue Program will perform both in situ hybridization to identify the
multiple cell types and seqFISH hybridization to capture the cell transcriptome of the identified cell types.
These technically demanding steps will require direction from established HuBMAP investigators as well as
UConn faculty who are experts in high resolution confocal microscopy. The Data Analysis Core will translate
the image files generated by these techniques into 3D cellular maps of the target tissue and transcriptome
composition of each cell type. From those data files, our contextual molecular mapping program, TOPAS, will
examine the transcriptional and signaling pathways to impute how neighboring cells coordinate their activities
to respond to mechanical loading and systemic factors that regulate skeletal health. The workflow and
analytical platforms that we developed for the skeletal system will be aligned with the requirement of the HIVE
including an outreach initiative. First, we will provide opportunities to transfer the histological technology to
major academic skeletal research groups. Second, once our skeletal data becomes available from the central
HIVE source, we will develop virtual workshops to inform the skeletal biology community of this valuable
resource and how it can be utilized to unravel rare diseases affecting the skeleton. HuBMAP will be a
transformational technology that every tissue centric group needs to incorporate. Our role is to ensure that the
skeletal biology community is included in this new experimental platform, and that it is employed to solve the
major genetic and therapeutic challenges affecting skeletal health.",507705

The healthy human body is composed of trillions of cells, whose molecular contents, spatial organization,
interactions, and molecular contents are carefully regulated and precisely structured. While transformative
advances in technology enable new types of anatomical, histological, spatial and single cell measurements, new
methods for data integration are essential to discover commonalities across diverse human beings, and discover
relationships between modalities across multiple scales. This requires novel computational frameworks,
algorithms and scaled software. Here, we will leverage this unique opportunity to construct an integrated spatial
and molecular map for the human body, by designing new methods to infer a Common Coordinate Framework
(CCF) for both absolute positions and relative relationships, ‘geolocate’ new data points onto it, and enable
querying and exploration from the biological community to derive new insights and hypotheses. We will (1)
construct a CCF across multiple scales of human anatomy, a 3-d spatial representation of the human body with
coordinate systems based on common features across individuals. To do this, we will develop a powerful suite
of integration tools using a strategy based on ‘semi-supervised’ manifold alignment. (2) Develop analytical
strategies to ‘geolocate’ new data onto this framework, thereby displaying the entirety of HuBMAP data on a
conserved scaffold of human anatomy, suitable for both highly structured organs, distributed systems, and
dynamical tissues; (3) Build infrastructure to allow users to flexibly explore and query this dataset, to identify
relationships between molecular composition, tissue organization, and anatomical structure. Our MC will create
an integrated atlas of a healthy human, representing a landmark public resource that will lead to transformative
insights into the organization, interaction, and regulation of cells, tissues and organs across the human body.",348938

Recent technological advances in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics allow for rapid generation of
comprehensive 3D-human tissue maps for biomolecules DNAs, RNAs, and proteins at the single-cell resolution
in the HuBMAP consortium. However, single-cell technologies for characterizing functional modifications are
lagging far behind but equally important as these existing omics technologies. Protein phosphorylation is one of
the most important modifications and often used as an indicator of signaling pathway activation (cell functional
state). The lack of high-spatial-resolution phosphoproteomic characterization of human tissues in the HuBMAP
consortium represents a significant knowledge gap for achieving a more complete understanding of how tissue
heterogeneity impacts human health. The objective of this TTD application is to address this gap by developing
a convenient streamlined platform for enabling automated high-resolution 3D-phosphoproteome mapping of
human tissues. The project feasibility is strongly supported by our recent progress in many aspects of technology
development: 1) Carrier-assisted sample preparation (CASP) for both global and targeted proteomics analysis of
1-100 cells; 2) A boosting to amplify signal with isobaric labeling (BASIL) strategy for high-throughput single-
cell proteomics; 3) BASIL/Tip-IMAC (immobilized metal affinity chromatography) for rapid phosphoproteomic
analysis of small numbers of cells; 4) Advanced liquid chromatography (LC) separation and disruptive mass
spectrometry (MS) technologies (e.g., multi-emitter array technology and sub-ambient pressure ionization with
nanoelectrospray (SPIN) source) for improving MS detection sensitivity. In the UG3 phase, Aim 1 will focus on
the development of a streamlined platform through 1) improving phospho-recovery by developing an improved
CASP/online IMAC platform for automated processing and phospho-enrichment, and 2) leveraging multiple
disruptive technologies developed at our group with integration of a high-efficiency multi-emitter SPIN (mSPIN)
source and BASIL-based sample multiplexing for significantly improving MS sensitivity by ~50-fold and sample
throughput by >20-fold. The streamlined platform will allow for precise quantification of ~1,000 phosphosites
in single cells and ~7000 phosphosites in 10 cells with >1000 samples per day. Aim 2 will demonstrate the
streamlined platform for enabling 2D-phosphoproteome mapping of mouse uterine tissues when combined with
laser capture microdissection (LCM) and standard tube-based voxel collection. In the UH3 phase (Aim 3) we will
further optimize the streamlined platform for automated robust phosphoproteomic analysis of LCM-dissected
human tissue sections. We then will validate the streamlined platform for high-resolution 3D-phosphoproteome
mapping of human breast and uterine tissues and other human tissues from the HuBMAP consortium. An easy-
to-use visualization tool will be developed to generate 3D maps that can be quickly and easily accessible by the
research community. With its antibody-free feature, the streamlined platform can be equally applicable to any
types of tissues. We envision that the streamlined platform will become an indispensable tool for high-resolution
3D-phosphopeoteome mapping of human tissues in the HuBMAP consortium and extend the HuBMAP toolbox
for 3D-mapping of functional modifications. In turn, it will make substantial contributions to improve our
understanding of tissue biology and accelerate the movement toward precision medicine.",400000

The small bowel and colon are organs critical for maintaining homeostasis of the human body by
mediating nutritional absorption upon the ingestion of food. Though both organs are extensive in length,
there are known differences in function and cellular heterogeneity within different portions of each. Also,
a cross section anywhere in the bowel reveals a complex layering of components involved in absorption
and secretion, motility of gut contents, circulation, and immunity. In this submission, we propose the
establishment of the Stanford Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) to map the complexity of the the small
bowel and colon with cell-to-cell resolution in histologic sections, both along their lengths and across
multiple individuals. To accomplish this goal, we will collect tissues from brain-dead organ donors with
explicit consent for distribution among the HuBMAP consortium and open access genome data sharing
(GDS). Two sets of technologies will then be employed. Tissue samples will be subjected to single cell
(sc) ATAC-seq and scRNA-seq. These ‘omic profiles will then be spatially mapped back to histologic
sections using a highly multiplexed system of antibody-tagged target epitopes, which we call
CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX). An integrative analysis will be performed to identify proteins
important to establishing the identity of each cell population within the tissue.

This application proposes the founding of a Tissue Mapping Center (TMC)
for the human eye and pancreas within the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP). The mission of the
proposed TMC is to build a platform of integrated technologies for imaging and molecular analysis that enables
the construction of comprehensive 3-dimensional molecular atlases of human eye and pancreas. This TMC will
leverage the unique resources of the Mass Spectrometry Research Center and the National Research
Resource for Imaging Mass Spectrometry at Vanderbilt University, the world-class clinical environment of the
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the distinguished expertise of Organ Specific Project team leaders in
their respective fields and their vast experience in organ procurement and management, and the advanced
biocomputational infrastructure available to the TMC through the Data Analysis Core laboratories at Vanderbilt
University and the Delft University of Technology, Netherlands to create a capability to molecularly
characterize human tissues in 3-dimensions at a level of understanding unrivaled by current technologies. The
innovative aspects of the proposed TMC are (1) the integration of imaging mass spectrometry, co-detection by
indexing (CODEX), stained microscopy, and autofluorescence microscopy into 3-dimensional molecular
atlases, (2) whole organ imaging of the eye, and (3) multi-organ atlases from the same donors through a
proposed collaboration with the currently funded University of Florida TMC. The application of the proposed
platform to organ-specific projects in pancreas and eye will provide a new paradigm of understanding the
normal state of these organs across vast scales, both molecular (e.g., lipids, metabolites, and proteins) and
spatial (e.g., whole organs to single cells). Furthermore, the involvement of these organs in diabetes, along
with organs currently funded by HuBMAP such as kidney and vasculature, will lay an important foundation for
future studies striving to understand the progression of diabetes. As a HuBMAP participant, the molecular
atlases produced by this TMC will be disseminated to collaborators to generate new hypotheses regarding the
function of these important organ systems, enabling new insight into human health and disease. This
multidisciplinary effort requires the creation and integration of three capabilities to 1) procure and manage
human tissue specimens, 2) determine and mitigate non-biological pre-analytical factors, and 3) acquire,
process, and disseminate multimodal 3-dimensional imaging and large-scale omics data.",751249

how homeostasis and disease intersect at the level of tissue physiology. A major challenge for performing multi-
omics using mass spectrometry imaging has been the (i) lack of universal ionization methods, (ii) limited sample
preparation protocols for preserving chemical gradients, (iii) low sensitivity, and (iv) limited tools for integration
of large quantities of data. Our laboratories are developing systematic MS imaging for high sensitivity and high
resolution analysis of diverse tissues. We discovered that water-based gas cluster ion beams (H2O-GCIB)
operating at high energy yield ionization enhancements of multiple biomolecules (e.g., metabolites, lipids, and
peptides/protein fragments) with high sensitivity at 1 µm lateral resolution and without labeling or complicated
sample preparation. Coupled with unique Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) instrumentation and
cryogenic sample handling, we have imaged biomolecules directly in cells and tissues in a near-native state (i.e.,
frozen-hydration) with feature resolution of 1-10 µm. Low concentration biomolecules (e.g. cardiolipin and
metabolites) that were impossible to localize in single cells previously are now visible with 3-dimensional
localization. Moreover, the sufficient signal per pixel, we can use automated data analysis to characterize
biologically active functional sites within 1 µm2 and areas of interest in single cells. We further developed data
integration methods to combine imaging data from adjacent sections to create a multi-model imaging data sets.
We propose to develop a pipeline for MS imaging analysis of biomolecules, and to elucidate molecular
heterogeneity in tissues using multimodal imaging. To support the multi-modal analysis pipeline, we will develop
an integrated data analysis platform. Integration of multiomics remains challenging, particularly spatially localize
multiple biomolecules at single cell level. The direct visualization of cellular contents provides information on
biomolecular composition, interactions and functions. This network of biomolecules is the driving force of specific
behavior of cells in physiological states. Despite this, a comprehensive grasp of these interactions at cellular
level has not moved beyond segregated methods. Our efforts will result in an integrated multimodal imaging
platform to summon the best characteristics of each image form, acquiring a complete picture the biomolecular
network at spatial resolution of 1 µm. With this direct visualization, we will address how metabolism links with
functional biomarkers that stem from metabolism-associated protein complexes and phase-separated
membrane-less organelles at the subcellular level, and how this drive different cell death modalities, including
different modes of cell death.",300000

Both human bone and heart present remarkable anatomical, cellular and functional heterogeneity, with
specialized cellular structures performing distinct yet essential physiological functions. A significant gap of
knowledge is that different cells' molecular signature, spatial distribution and interactions, and functional state
remain little understood for both organs. Although spatially separated, growing evidence suggests that a bone-
heart communication axis plays a critical role in normal development and pathogenesis of these two organs
and possibly other organs. Joint analysis of the two organs could reveal novel insights into the
microenvironment organization and signaling pathways underlying the inter-organ communication. We
therefore propose the in-depth characterization of these two organs which, together, account for a large
fraction of human disease burden. We will map molecular and cellular changes in the tissue over the course of
human lifespan using comprehensive multi-dimensional single-cell and imaging technologies. The final product
will impact research of these two organs in the following manner: 1) Organ Atlases: spatially resolved atlases
will provide a highly user friendly, publicly available, searchable database of the most comprehensive multi-
omic, single cell analysis of the two organs. Molecular data will be richly annotated with additional clinical and
epidemiological data. 2) Computational methods: in addition to the data, the critical computational tools and
pipelines developed in this project will be available to the research community. These include methods and
pipelines for processing multi-omics and imaging data, inference of cell-specific regulatory and signaling
pathways, correlation of mesoscale imaging and molecular imaging features, as well as database algorithms
for the query, exploration and visualization of highly complex data. 3) Access to biospecimens for follow-up
studies: biospecimens collected in this project will be banked and made available to the biomedical research
community. These include freshly frozen and fixed specimens and tissue sections. In summary, the proposed
project will broadly impact the entire research community and jumpstart basic-science and medical discoveries
based on a sophisticated understanding of the key molecular circuits underlying the development and aging of
these two organs.",500000

The respiratory system (RS: lung airways and alveolar parenchyma) and the urinary system
(US:kidney, ureters and bladder) are both critical to homeostasis. The RS subserves gas
exchange for cellular respiration and the US maintains fluid and electrolyte balance and
supports elimination of toxic substances. Together, they regulate acid-base balance. Both arise
via branching morphogenesis, are highly vascular, with a large endothelial/epithelial/neural
interface, and eliminate unwanted substance to the outside environment. They are thus “barrier
systems” that require extensive immune surveillance and are subject to environmental,
infectious and, inflammatory injury, and fibrotic disrepair. Failure of either systems results in
chronic debilitating diseases that are costly to manage. Improved understanding of both
systems at a high-resolution, high content multiscale level and the parenchymal-extra cellular
space interactions will provide remarkable insight into morphogenesis, homeostasis and
injury/repair of the body’s principal barriers. Characterizing the identities of all the cell types and
their spatial organization is the first step towards understanding the functions and malfunctions
of these organs. In this project we propose to build spatial multi-omics maps of RS and US
barrier organs at single-cell resolution, using a combination of highly efficient sequencing
approach on dissociated cells, and highly multiplexed in situ mapping of RNA and proteins with
fluorescent imaging.
We plan to accomplish this goal with three specific aims in a 4-year funded period. Aim 1. We
will establish an experimental and computation pipeline for generating and analyzing 3D multi-
omics maps for human tissues. This pipeline will include single-nucleus RNA sequencing and
chromatin accessibility mapping, highly multiplexed in situ imaging of RNA and proteins, and a
computational framework to integrate different types of data to create coherent spatial maps of
RNA, chromatin status and proteins. Aim 2. In one Organ Specific Project (OSP), we will create
a Lung Airways and Prenchymal Map (LAPMAP), covering the entire intrathoracic human
airway, as well as three critical niches of the human lung for both sexes. Aim 3. In a second
OSP, we will create the Bladder Ureter and Kidney Maps (BUKMAP), covering human kidney
and lower urinary tract.",1846838

Abstract
A breakthrough of this project is to simultaneously improve the state-of-art spatial resolution, dynamic range of
RNA quantification, and applicable dimensions of human tissue by one to several orders of magnitude. This
breakthrough will deliver to users extremely high-resolution, high-density, high-fidelity and reproducible spatial
mapping slides (HiFi slides) for spatial transcriptome analysis or spatial mapping of modified- or interacting-
nucleic acids. We will leverage HiFi slides to provide spatial transcriptome and spatial RNA-chromatin
interactome mapping tools in unprecedented resolution. This project will generate HiFi spatial transcriptome,
HiFi spatial RNA-crhomatin interactome, and high-resolution protein spatial profiles of 96 proteins from
mesenteric arteries of veins, and the microvasculature from pancreas, liver and brain. These datasets will form
the initial human EC biomolecular map (HuEC-MAP). These data will offer unprecedented insights to the
molecular nature of the tissue-specific morphologies and functions of the blood vessel endothelium, which are
critical to the development and functions of the associated tissues.",400000
