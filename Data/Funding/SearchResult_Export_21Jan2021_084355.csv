The healthy human body is composed of trillions of cells, whose molecular contents, spatial organization,
interactions, and molecular contents are carefully regulated and precisely structured. While transformative
advances in technology enable new types of anatomical, histological, spatial and single cell measurements, new
methods for data integration are essential to discover commonalities across diverse human beings, and discover
relationships between modalities across multiple scales. This requires novel computational frameworks,
algorithms and scaled software. Here, we will leverage this unique opportunity to construct an integrated spatial
and molecular map for the human body, by designing new methods to infer a Common Coordinate Framework
(CCF) for both absolute positions and relative relationships, ‘geolocate’ new data points onto it, and enable
querying and exploration from the biological community to derive new insights and hypotheses. We will (1)
construct a CCF across multiple scales of human anatomy, a 3-d spatial representation of the human body with
coordinate systems based on common features across individuals. To do this, we will develop a powerful suite
of integration tools using a strategy based on ‘semi-supervised’ manifold alignment. (2) Develop analytical
strategies to ‘geolocate’ new data onto this framework, thereby displaying the entirety of HuBMAP data on a
conserved scaffold of human anatomy, suitable for both highly structured organs, distributed systems, and
dynamical tissues; (3) Build infrastructure to allow users to flexibly explore and query this dataset, to identify
relationships between molecular composition, tissue organization, and anatomical structure. Our MC will create
an integrated atlas of a healthy human, representing a landmark public resource that will lead to transformative
insights into the organization, interaction, and regulation of cells, tissues and organs across the human body.",697234

to other HIVE components, TMCs, NIH program, and interacting with other atlas projects. Our design is based
upon existing substantial persistent infrastructure supported by many projects with a 30-year history. At PSC,
HuBMAP will be sustained for decades at reasonable cost and/or integrate with other programs. In addition to
leadership and grounded technology expertise, we are proposing full-time project management and imaging and
data science expertise within our team. These capabilities will allow the infrastructure component staff to engage
