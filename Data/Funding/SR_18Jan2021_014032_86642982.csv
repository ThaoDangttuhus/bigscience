To do this, we will apply a range of imaging and molecular profiling modalities, including in vivo MRI and ultrasound imaging, and ex vivo extracellular matrix proteomics, formal histopathologic evaluation, biomechanical testing, imaging mass cytometry, and spatial transcriptomics, with the resulting data being analyzed and distributed to the broader research community in collaboration with the HuBMAP Integration, Visualization, and Engagement (HIVE) Collaboratory. This project is relevant to public health because the resulting 3D multiscale maps of normal female reproductive tissues will serve as key frames of reference for future studies aiming to discover how perturbation of tissue structure and/or function leads to organ dysfunction in common, yet poorly understood, conditions such as preeclampsia, endometriosis, female infertility, and gynecologic cancers.",NICHD,10119154,22-SEP-2020,RFA-RM-20-002,1U54HD104393-01,1,U54,HD,104393,01,,"HALVORSON, LISA M",25-SEP-2020,31-AUG-2022,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-BST-U (50)R),,9491679,"LAURENT, LOUISE CHANG",Not Applicable,52,OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY,804355790,US,32.881785,-117.236973,577507,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",LA JOLLA,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,92093-0934,UNITED STATES, ,25-SEP-2020,31-AUG-2021,865,Research Centers,2020,OD,405652,194348,600000,
